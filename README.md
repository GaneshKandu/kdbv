# mysql databade auto schema migration tool 
#### ``kdbv library``  migrations between versions of a application.

![](https://github.com/GaneshKandu/kdbv/blob/master/.github/kdbv.png)

> upgrade your mysql database to current latest version from older version

## Common DB versioning problems
* Where should I keep track of schema changes?
* What changed since last production push?
* Did I apply this patch already to this server?
* Did I run the migrations on this copy of the app?
* Did I run the update script after updating the schema?

## How kdbv library helps

* Each DB change encapsulated in a single migration ```kdbv database file```
* Deployment script automatically runs all necessary migration sql queries on production database immediately after code deploys
* Nothing to remember / eliminates human factor
* Easy to test, easy to reproduce
* A ```kdbv library``` is code that changes the database structure between versions

## How its works
Like the source files in our project,the database is constantly changing too. Thatâ€™s why we also need a way to track the changes of database versioning but using ```kdbv``` you don't need to keep track of changes just run make to create ```kdbv database``` and deploy with your latest change and run ```update``` function to change database automatically database upgraded thats is it

``` php
require('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Usage

### steps to perform
* Create ```kdbv database``` using ```make``` function of your ```latest database```
* deploy ```kdbv database``` with your application
* You can simply overwrite latest version of your application on your old version of application ( **NOTES** latest version is deployed with ```kdbv database``` and ```kdbv library``` ) 
* now you have your latest changed files with your old database which need to be update to new changes database structure
* now ```upgrade``` your database using ```upgrade``` function
* **ALL DONE ENJOY**
* if you getting any issue [create an issue](https://github.com/GaneshKandu/kdbv/issues)

### step 1

#### Instantiate & load()

```php
// Using kdbv namespace
namespace kanduganesh;
// just use this code to require auto loader on the top of your projects.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
// Initialize
$obj = new kdbv(array(
	'HOST' => '<mysql_host>',
	'DATABASE' => '<mysql_database>',
	'USER' => '<database_user>',
	'PASS' => '<database_password>',
	'PORT' => '<mysql_port>',
	'KDBV' => '<kdbv_database_name>' //name of kdbv database
	'PREFIX' => '<table prefix>', //table prefix
));
```
> ```<kdbv_database_name>``` is a name of ```kdbv database``` which to be deploy with your application
( _kdbv database contain database structure of your latest application_ )

### step 2
> use ```$obj``` of step 1
#### create ```kdbv database```

```
/*
Create kdbv database
notes :- during calling make function your mysql database should contain latest version database so it can store latest structure of database 
*/
$obj->make(); 
```
### step 3
> use ```$obj``` of step 1
#### Get Mysql Upgrade Queries
```php
$sqls_queries = $obj->query();
foreach($sqls_queries as $query){
    echo $query."\n";
}
```
## or
### Upgrade mysql database
```php
/*
upgrade mysql database
notes :- during calling upgrade function your kdbv database should be deployed with your application
Upgrade your old mysql database to your latest mysql database structure
*/
$obj->upgrade();
```

## Best practices
* run ```$obj->make();``` all time you when you release new application version with change database structure
